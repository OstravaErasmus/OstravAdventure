                      <p> Discovering New Cultures and Making Lifelong Connections
                        <br>As my Erasmus journey in Ostrava comes to a close, I can't help but reflect on the incredible experiences and personal growth I have gained during this time. My decision to embark on this adventure was driven by a desire to immerse myself in a new culture, make lifelong connections, and broaden my horizons. Looking back, I can confidently say that it has been an unforgettable experience.
                        <br>
                      </p><p>
                        <p><br> The journey began with a train ride to Prague. I remember taking the train on a Friday morning at 11 am, eager to embark on this new chapter. Little did I know that fate had a different plan in store for me. The train ended up being delayed by a whopping 1 hour and 30 minutes, causing me to miss my bus from the Prague train station to the airport. Frantically, I had to sprint to catch another bus, praying that I would make it in time.

                          By some stroke of luck, I arrived at the airport just in the nick of time to check in my luggage. Breathing a sigh of relief, I boarded the plane, ready to embark on my Erasmus adventure in Ostrava. The anticipation filled the air as I eagerly anticipated the experiences that awaited me.
                          
                          Upon my arrival, I was greeted with open arms by the warm and welcoming community in Ostrava. The diverse group of international students quickly became my second family. Together, we navigated the challenges of living in a foreign country, creating a support system that would carry us through the highs and lows of our Erasmus journey.

                        <p><br>
                          During my time in Ostrava, I had the pleasure of immersing myself in a rich and unique culture. From exploring the architectural wonders of the city to indulging in traditional Czech cuisine, each day offered an opportunity to embrace the local customs and traditions. And I couldn't resist sharing a piece of this cultural experience with my family.

Before leaving for Ostrava, I had purchased typical Czech pastries and cakes as a special treat for my family. This weekend, as they picked me up at the airport in Lyon, I presented them with these delectable delights. It was a small gesture, but it allowed me to share a taste of my Erasmus journey with them and express my gratitude for their unwavering support.

As I bid farewell to Ostrava and reflect on my time here, I am filled with a sense of gratitude and fulfillment. This Erasmus experience has not only allowed me to grow personally and academically but has also provided me with cherished memories and lifelong connections.
                          <p>
                            <p>While the journey to Ostrava may have been filled with unexpected twists and turns, it only added to the excitement and adventure that awaited me. As I return home, I carry with me the lessons learned, the friendships formed, and the appreciation for cultural diversity that will forever shape my outlook on life. </p>
                            <p><br>
                              Ostrava, thank you for the unforgettable Erasmus experience. And to my family, thank you for your unwavering support and for joining me in this journey, even if it was through the delectable taste of Czech pastries. As I close this chapter, I eagerly await the next adventure that life has in store for me.     </p>
